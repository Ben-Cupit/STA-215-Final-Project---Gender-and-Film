# STA-215-Final-Project---Gender-and-Film
This project looks at how gender is represented in popular films under a number of lenses: number of female named characters, ratio of female-to-male characters, whether or not films pass the Bechdel Test, and whether or not females within the movie meaningfully move the plot forward.
